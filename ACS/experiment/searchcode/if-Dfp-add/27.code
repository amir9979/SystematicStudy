* For example, category value N for a DFP can be achieved by 3,4,5,6, or more DFP instances being present
* in one of the generated input models. But if we get one with 3 it is already covered and another with 4
String dfpCat = value012NFor(state.dfpCount());
//store DFP category as achieve coverage value
coverage.addVariableValue(&quot;DFP&quot;, dfpCat);
