* Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Try to solve it in linear time/space.

Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
public int maximumGap2(int[] num) {
if (num == null || num.length < 2)
return 0;
// get the max and min value of the array
