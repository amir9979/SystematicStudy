and a permutation vector pivot of length height so that matrixToDecompose(pivot,:) = lowerTriangularFactor*U.
If height < width, then lowerTriangularFactor is height-by-height and U is height-by-width.
The matrixToDecomposeElements decompostion with pivoting always exists, even if the matrix is
singular, so the constructor will never fail.  The primary use of the
