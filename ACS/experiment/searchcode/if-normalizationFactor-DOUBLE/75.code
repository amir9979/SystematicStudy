* - then the weights of the corresponding points are:
*   - w1 = 1/3
*   - w2 = 1/6
*   - w3 = 1/7
* That means, if the divergence to P1 is only half the divergence to P2 then the weight of P1 is double that of P2.
* If the distance-metric were the real spatial distance then this algorithm would be trivialized to &quot;if a point is
