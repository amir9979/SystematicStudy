* <li>The bracketed solution means that we have the opportunity to only return roots that are greater than or equal to the actual root, or are less than or equal to the actual root. That is, we can control whether under-approximations and over-approximations are {@link AllowedSolution allowed solutions}. Other root-finding algorithms can usually only guarantee that the solution (the root that was found) is around the actual root.</li>
* For backwards compatibility, all root-finding algorithms must have {@link AllowedSolution#ANY_SIDE ANY_SIDE} as default for the allowed solutions.
