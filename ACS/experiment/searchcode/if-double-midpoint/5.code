* Write a method named hasMidpoint that accepts three integers as parameters and returns true if one of the integers
* is the midpoint between the other two integers; that is, if one integer is exactly halfway between them.
* Your method should return false if no such midpoint relationship exists.
* The integers could be passed in any order; the midpoint could be the 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
