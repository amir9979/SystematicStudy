/* inOrderEqual
Given three ints, a b c, return true if they are in strict increasing order, such as 2 5 11, or 5 6 7, but not 6 5 7 or 5 5 7. However, with the exception that if &quot;equalOk&quot; is true, equality is allowed, such as 5 5 7 or 5 5 5.
public boolean inOrderEqual(int a, int b, int c, boolean equalOk) {
if (equalOk)
return a<=b &amp;&amp; b<=c;
return a<b &amp;&amp; b<c;
}
