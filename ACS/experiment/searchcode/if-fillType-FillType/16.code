are arrows in a broad sense - they could be T-bars for example.
<p>
ArrowShapes have a fill type. FillType can be OPEN, CLOSED or WIRE.
The fillType determines whether the body of the arrow head is filled
getFillShape() optionally defines a different shape for the body. If there
is no separate fillShape defined, the same shape is used for the outline
