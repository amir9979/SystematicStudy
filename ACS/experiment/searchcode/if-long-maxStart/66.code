* We will use a nested loop to update the matrix. The outer loop is for the len of substring, we will start from short substring to long substring
* The inner loop is for the left and right of the substring.
* If we found chars at left and right are same, and dp[left+1][right-1] = true, then we will update dp[left][right] to be true
