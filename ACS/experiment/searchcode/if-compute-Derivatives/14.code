check (using instanceof) whether the token is a SmoothToken, and if so,
access these derivatives using the {@link #derivativeValues()} method,
Note that if two SmoothTokens are added or subtracted, then the derivatives also
add or subtract. If the times of the two tokens that are added or subtracted are
