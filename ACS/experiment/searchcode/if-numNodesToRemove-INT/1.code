* The average number of nodes to add/remove and QEdges to change is computed as follows:
*
* [ int numNodesToAdd =    numStates * dynamicity * dGamma ]
* [ int numNodesToRemove = numStates * dynamicity * dGamma ]
// we can not remove all nodes, because the one where the agent is on should never be removed
int numNodesToRemove = MathOperations.getRandomInt(avgNodesToRemove, variance, 1, mdp.countActions());
