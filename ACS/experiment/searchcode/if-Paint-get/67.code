* A Painter implementation that uses a Paint to fill the entire background area. For example, if I wanted to paint the
* entire background of a panel green, I would:
protected void doPaint(Graphics2D g2d, T obj, int width, int height) {
Paint paint = getFillPaint();

if (paint == null)
return;
if (isPaintStretched())
paint = calculateSnappedPaint(paint, width, height);
