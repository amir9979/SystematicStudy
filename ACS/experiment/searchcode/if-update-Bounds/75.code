* Contains the message from a TimeBoundsHandler to a TimeBoundsListener. If the
* new TimeBounds is null, then the TimeBoundsHandler has gone inactive (nothing
* providing time bounds). If it isn&#39;t and the old TimeBounds is null, the
* TimeBoundsHandler has gone active (something is now providing time bounds).
