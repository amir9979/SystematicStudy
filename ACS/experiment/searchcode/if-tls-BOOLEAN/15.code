* // to get a TlsPolicy you can use with a TlsConnection:
* TlsPolicy tlsPolicy = factory.getTlsPolicy();
* // or if you want to see a description of the TlsPolicy and information about where the TlsPolicy came from:
* The instantiated TlsPolicyFactory maintains a reference to the provided instance
* of TxtHostRecord or TblHosts so if that instance changes and you call getTlsPolicy
