* Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2blc5a3. If the &quot;compressed&quot; string would not become smaller than the orig- inal string, your method should return the original string.
public class StringCompression {

public String compress(String str1){

if(str1.isEmpty()){
return str1;
}

char[] inputStr1 = str1.toCharArray();
