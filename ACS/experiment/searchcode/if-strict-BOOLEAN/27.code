* An XOR gate. There are two modes of operation for this gate: strict and non-strict.
* While in strict mode, if exactly one input is set to true, the output will be true,
public void setStrict(boolean strict) {
this.strict = strict;
}

@Override
public void tick() {
if (strict) {
boolean temp = false;
