* The Julian calendar does not have a year zero, and so year -1 is followed by
* year 1. If the Gregorian cutover date is specified at or before year -1
LocalDate cutoverDate = new LocalDate(cutoverInstant.getMillis(), GregorianChronology.getInstance(zone));
if (cutoverDate.getYear() <= 0) {
throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;Cutover too early. Must be on or after 0001-01-01.&quot;);
